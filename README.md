# SuperTux: An Old Adventure
License is CC-BY-SA 4.0, I'll put it here soon.

## THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS README.
Somehow, Nolok has accidentally reverted the world to an older version, and Tux woke up in this new world!

Something even more strange, is that there's more stuff, like an entire grassland, for example.

Tux must find Nolok and get him to bring things back to normal... and he needs to find Penny, because she went missing. But is she even Penny anymore? No! Of course not! She's Gown now because everything was reverted.

## Info
There will be 8 levels per world, and there's more than 2 worlds here, so the worlds are below.

### Worlds
1. Antarctica (I'm just gonna put here that this add-on needs a remake of the darkstone / metal tiles from the 0.0.6 version of SuperTux. I'll probably use industrial tiles as placeholders, but darkstone tiles are still needed)
2. Grassland (Needs worldmap and level graphics, I'm using the forest graphics as placeholders)
3. Desert (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
4. Temple (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
5. City (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
6. Mountain (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
7. Moon (Needs worldmap graphics, will use Jagged Rock tiles for the levels. Decorations for levels are needed, though)
8. Volcano (Needs worldmap graphics, will use Jagged Rock tiles for the levels. Decorations for levels are needed??? I could wait until Tropical Paradise exists since that apparently contains volcano rock images, I don't wanna steal from the World 3 Graphics pull request)

## Contributing Stuff
If you contribute new tiles, whether that is level or worldmap tiles, unless you add the tiles to tiles.strf or ice_world.strf yourself, please make them be 128 in horizontal size. Vertical size can be anything that's a multiple of 32, obviously.

This is so tiles can be added easily.

## Development Status
Antarctica is being worked on.
