## THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS README.
Somehow, Nolok has accidentally reverted the world to an older version, and Tux woke up in this new world!

Something even more strange, is that there's more stuff, like an entire grassland, for example.

Tux must find Nolok and get him to bring things back to normal... and he needs to find Penny, because she went missing. But is she even Penny anymore? No! Of course not! She's Gown now because everything was reverted.

## How To Play The Add-On
Put the folder in this repository in your supertux2 save folder's levels folder. Make sure you're using the latest nightly build! And also, do not rename the folder unless you want things to break!

I don't see this being in the add-on repository anytime soon, so you'll have to do what I said above. Another thing, if anyone from SuperTux Team sees this and wants to add it to the add-on repository (again, I don't see this happening at all), you have permission to do that.

## Info
There will be 8 levels per world, and there's more than 2 worlds here, so the worlds are below.

### Worlds
1. Antarctica (Needs worldmap graphics, might just use SuperTux 0.1.3's Icy Island worldmap graphics)
2. Grassland (Needs worldmap graphics and leaves for the tree)
3. Desert (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
4. Temple (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
5. City (Needs worldmap and level graphics)
6. Mountain (Needs worldmap graphics)
7. Moon (Needs worldmap graphics)
8. Volcano (Needs worldmap graphics)

## Contributing Stuff
If you contribute new tiles, whether that is level or worldmap tiles, unless you add the tiles to tiles.strf or ice_world.strf yourself, please make them be 128 in horizontal size. Vertical size can be anything that's a multiple of 32, obviously.

This is so tiles can be added easily.

## Development Status
The whole thing is being reset to make it be more like 0.0.6
