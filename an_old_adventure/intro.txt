	Tux was sleeping one day, when the
	world was reverted back to an older
	version!
	
	Tux knew this is what the world looked
	like when he was a child, but he was
	confused. Who did this, and why?
	
	He had to save the world. That's all
	Tux knew.
	
	So, he started running and jumping

	how long this adventure would be...")) )
